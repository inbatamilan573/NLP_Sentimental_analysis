# Project Highlights:

Extensive Data Collection: The project involved the collection and processing of a staggering 33 lakhs (3.3 million) of Amazon reviews, making it one of the largest datasets used for sentiment analysis. This extensive dataset allows for a comprehensive analysis of sentiments expressed by users.

Data Preprocessing: To ensure data quality and consistency, the dataset underwent rigorous data preprocessing. Techniques such as text cleaning, tokenization, and feature engineering were employed to prepare the data for analysis.

High Accuracy Sentiment Analysis: The project's primary achievement is a highly accurate sentiment analysis model that boasts an impressive 87% accuracy rate. This accuracy rate demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in categorizing reviews as positive or negative.

Real-time Sentiment Analysis: To make sentiment analysis accessible and user-friendly, a real-time user interface was created using Dash. Users can input text, and the system provides instant sentiment predictions, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.

# Technologies and Tools Used:

Python: The primary programming language for data analysis, machine learning, and web application development.

NLP Libraries: Utilized Natural Language Processing libraries for text preprocessing and feature engineering.

Dash: A web application framework used to build the real-time user interface for sentiment analysis.
